Over the last twelve years, the University has responded to changes in national educational policy, to demographic shifts, to a radically different economy and marketplace requirements, to emerging local and regional needs, and to new technologies.
</p><p>
All of these changes have led, in turn, to new expectations on the part of students, staff, and administrators. The University equips individuals with skills needed for effective contribution to society. This work is currently done through eleven faculties that provide a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs.
</p><p>
The results reached in many programs involving international collaboration - particularly in mobility programs like Socrates, PHARE, Leonardo de Vinci, etc.—are indeed impressive and are among the best achievements of the University.
</p><p>
The overall impression we received of WUT is that of a very creative, energetic, active, and innovative University. All staff members, both teaching and research, are very enthusiastic and determined to experiment with all the new opportunities and modalities offered by I.T. Furthermore good multimedia tools were available in most classrooms in the new buildings, ( e.g. those of Economic Sciences and Law).
